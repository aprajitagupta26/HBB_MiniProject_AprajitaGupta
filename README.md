Capstone project for BioinformHer Module 2 – Evolutionary Conservation of the HBB Gene
# HBB Mini Project – BioinformHer Module 2

## 🔬 Project Title
**Tracking the Evolution of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) Gene Across Species**

## 🧠 Project Objective
To analyze the evolutionary conservation of the HBB gene across six vertebrate species using core bioinformatics tools. This includes sequence retrieval, pairwise and multiple alignments, sequence logo creation, and phylogenetic tree construction.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **NCBI BLASTp** – Sequence retrieval and similarity search
- **EMBOSS Needle** – Pairwise sequence alignment
- **Clustal Omega** – Multiple sequence alignment
- **Skylign** – Sequence logo generation
- **MEGA X** – Phylogenetic tree construction

## 📋 Tasks Performed
1. Retrieved HBB protein sequences from NCBI for six species
2. Performed BLASTp to identify homologous sequences
3. Aligned human HBB sequence with chimpanzee and zebrafish using EMBOSS Needle
4. Conducted Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) using Clustal Omega
5. Generated sequence logo using Skylign
6. Constructed a phylogenetic tree using MEGA X
7. Interpreted evolutionary relationships and conserved regions

## 🧬 Conclusion
This project demonstrated how the HBB gene is highly conserved in mammals, especially between human and chimpanzee, and diverges in distant species like zebrafish. The analysis showed how vital functional genes are preserved through evolution and how bioinformatics tools help in studying these patterns.
